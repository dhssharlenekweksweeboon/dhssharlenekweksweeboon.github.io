<p> Girl guides to me is about learning to be independent, working with people and defintely being a caring person. </p>
<p> When I first join girl guides, it was a very scary experience as I had to work with unfamiliar faces and tall seniors which I was uncomfortable 
with, however, after the bonding session, i realised how kind and caring the seniors all were. They teached me the different skills slowly and patiently
and were willing to give up their time on friday mornings just to meet and teach me and my batchmates the required skills.</p>
<p>What I enjoy really much about guides is that we are just like one big family, we share the food we make from outdoor cooking and endure physical training together.
Although sometimes guides may be very strenuous, however doing every single thing with my petrol and making memories together was definitely worth it. I love girl guides!!
